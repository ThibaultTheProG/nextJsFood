# nextJsFood

Project on Next.js to practise using the framework.

The idea of the project is to create an application that lists recipes and allows anyone to add recipes. Les images sont stockées sur AWS.

If you want to use the application to send your recipes, you need to create an ‘.env.local’ file at the root of your project. Here are the lines to fill in in the file :

AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=/*YOUR PUBLIC ACCESS KEY*/
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=/*YOUR PRIVATE ACCESS KEY*/

You will find the access keys in your AWS account.
